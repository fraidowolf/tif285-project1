    "### A note about priors\n",
    "\n",
    "The prior allows inclusion of other information into the computation, which becomes very useful in cases where multiple measurement strategies are being combined to constrain a single model. The necessity to specify a prior, however, is one of the more controversial pieces of Bayesian analysis.\n",
    "A frequentist will point out that the prior is problematic when no true prior information is available. Though it might seem straightforward to use a noninformative prior like the flat prior mentioned above, there are some [surprisingly subtleties](http://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2013/07/13/lost-causes-in-statistics-ii-noninformative- priors/comment-page-1/) involved. It turns out that in many situations, a truly noninformative prior does not exist! Frequentists point out that the subjective choice of a prior which necessarily biases your result has no place in statistical data analysis.\n",
    "A Bayesian would counter that frequentism doesn't solve this problem, but simply skirts the question. Frequentism can often be viewed as simply a special case of the Bayesian approach for some (implicit) choice of the prior: a Bayesian would say that it's better to make this implicit choice explicit, even if the choice might include some subjectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Photon Counts: Bayesian approach in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaving these philosophical debates aside for the time being, let's address how Bayesian results are generally computed in practice. For a one parameter problem like the one considered here, it's as simple as computing the posterior probability $p(F_\\mathrm{true} | D,I)$ as a function of $F_\\mathrm{true}$: this is the distribution reflecting our knowledge of the parameter $F_\\mathrm{true}$.\n",
    "But as the dimension of the model grows, this direct approach becomes increasingly intractable. For this reason, Bayesian calculations often depend on sampling methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For this practical example, let us apply an MCMC approach using Dan Foreman-Mackey's [emcee](http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/) package. Keep in mind here that the goal is to generate a set of points drawn from the posterior probability distribution, and to use those points to determine the answer we seek.\n",
    "To perform this MCMC, we start by defining Python functions for the prior $p(F_\\mathrm{true} | I)$, the likelihood $p(D | F_\\mathrm{true},I)$, and the posterior $p(F_\\mathrm{true} | D,I)$, noting that none of these need be properly normalized. Our model here is one-dimensional, but to handle multi-dimensional models we'll define the model in terms of an array of parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, which in this case is $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = [F_\\mathrm{true}]$"

    "## Aside: Best estimates and confidence intervals\n",
    "The posterior distribution from our Bayesian data analysis is the key quantity that encodes our inference about the values of the model parameters, given the data and the relevant background information. Often, however, we wish to summarize this result with just a few numbers: the best estimate and a measure of its reliability. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few different options for this. The choice of the most appropriate one depends mainly on the shape of the posterior distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symmetric posterior pdfs\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the probability (density) associated with any particular value of the parameter is a measure of how much we believe that it lies in the neighbourhood of that point, our best estimate is given by the maximum of the posterior pdf. If we denote the quantity of interest by $\\theta$, with a posterior pdf $P =p(\\theta|D,I)$, then the best estimate of its value $\\theta_0$ is given by the condition $dP/d\\theta|_{\\theta=\\theta_0}=0$. Strictly speaking, we should also check the sign of the second derivative to ensure that $\\theta_0$ represents a maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain a measure of the reliability of this best estimate, we need to look at the width or spread of the posterior pdf about $\\theta_0$. When considering the behaviour of any function in the neighbourhood of a particular point, it is often helpful to carry out a Taylor series expansion; this is simply a standard tool for (locally) approximating a complicated function by a low-order polynomial. The linear term is zero at the maximum and the quadratic term is often the dominating one determining the width of the posterior pdf. Ignoring all the higher-order terms we arrive at the Gaussian approximation (see more details below)"

Alternatively one can compute the mean value, $\\langle \\theta \\rangle = \\int \\theta p(\\theta|D,I) d\\theta$, although this tends to overemphasise very long tails. The best option is probably a compromise that can be employed when having access to a large sample from the posterior (as provided by an MCMC), namely to give the median of this ensemble.\n",

    "Furthermore, the concept of an error-bar does not seem appropriate in this case, as it implicitly entails the idea of symmetry. A good way of expressing the reliability with which a parameter can be inferred, for an asymmetric posterior pdf, is rather through a *confidence interval*. Since the area under the posterior pdf between $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ is proportional to how much we believe that $\\theta$ lies in that range, the shortest interval that encloses 67% of the area represents a sensible measure of the uncertainty of the estimate. Obviously we can choose to provide some other degree-of-belief that we think is relevant for the case at hand. Assuming that the posterior pdf has been normalized, to have unit area, we need to find $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ such that:"

There is no difficulty when one of the maxima is very much larger than the others: we can simply ignore the subsidiary solutions, to a good approximation, and concentrate on the global maximum. The problem arises when there are several maxima of comparable magnitude. What do we now mean by a best estimate, and how should we quantify its reliability? The idea of a best estimate and an error-bar, or even a confidence interval, is merely an attempt to summarize the posterior with just two or three numbers; sometimes this just can’t be done, and so these concepts are not valid. For the bimodal case we might be able to characterize the posterior in terms of a few numbers: two best estimates and their associated error-bars, or disjoint confidence intervals. For a general multimodal pdf, the most honest thing we can do is just display the posterior itself.\n",
