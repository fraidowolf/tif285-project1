======= Laplace's method =======
The idea behind the Laplace approximation is simple. We assume that an unnormalized probability density $P^*(\theta)$ has a peak at a point $\theta_0$. We are interested in the evidence, $Z_P$, which is given by the normalizing constant
$$
Z_P = \int P^*(\theta) d^K\theta,
$$ 
where we consider the general case in which $\theta$ is in a $K$-dimensional space. 

We Taylor-expand the logarithm $\log P^*$ around the peak:
$$
\log P^*(\theta) = \log P^*(\theta_0) - \frac{1}{2} (\theta - \theta_0)^T \Sigma (\theta - \theta_0) + \ldots,
$$
where $\Sigma$ is the matrix of second derivatives at the maximum
$$
\Sigma_{ij} = - \left. \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j}  \log P^*(\theta)\right|_{\theta=\theta_0}.
$$
We then approximate $P^*(\theta)$ by an unnormalized Gaussian, 
$$
Q^*(\theta) \equiv P^*(\theta_0) \exp \left[ - \frac{1}{2}(\theta - \theta_0)^T \Sigma (\theta - \theta_0) \right],
$$
and we approximate the normalizing constant $Z_P$ by the normalizing constant
of this Gaussian,
$$
Z_P \approx Z_Q = P^*(\theta_0) \sqrt{\frac{(2\pi)^K}{\det\Sigma}}.
$$
Predictions can then be made using this approximation $Q$. Physicists also call this widely-used approximation the saddle-point approximation.
    
The fact that the normalizing constant of a Gaussian is given by 
$$
\int d^K\theta \exp \left[ - \frac{1}{2}\theta^T \Sigma \theta \right] = \sqrt{\frac{(2\pi)^K}{\det\Sigma}},
$$
can be proved by making an orthogonal transformation into the basis $u$ in which $\Sigma$ is transformed into a diagonal matrix. The integral then separates into a product of one-dimensional integrals, each of the form
$$
\int du_i \exp \left[ -\frac{1}{2} \lambda_i u_i^2 \right] = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{\lambda_i}}
$$
The product of the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ is the determinant of $\Sigma$.
