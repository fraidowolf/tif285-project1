So far, we have been concerned with the problem of parameter estimation. In studying the linear relationship between two quantities, for example, we discussed how to infer the slope and the offset of the associated straight-line model. Often, however, there is a question as to whether a quadratic, or even cubic, function might be a more appropriate model. In this lecture, we will consider the broad class of scientific problems when there is uncertainty as to which one of a set of alternative models is most suitable. In the Bayesian terminology these can be labeled as _Model Selection_ problems and we will discuss them in some depth.

One of the main objectives in science is that of inferring the truth of one or more hypotheses about how some aspect of nature works. Because we are always in a state of incomplete information, we can never prove any hypothesis (theory) is true.

We will start, however, with a brief discussion on sampling theory and the frequentist approach to _hypothesis testing_. This will involve the introduction of the $P$-value or significance measure---quantities that are often misinterpreted even by scientists themselves. See, for example, the following comment published in Nature (March 20, 2019): "Scientists rise up against statistical significance": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9".

======= Evidence calculations =======
The actual computation of Bayesian evidences can be a challenging task. Recall that we often have knowledge of the posterior distribution only through sampling. In many cases, the simple Laplace method can be used to compute the evidence approximately, while in other cases we have to rely on special sampling algorithms such as nested sampling or parallel tempering with thermodynamic integration.
