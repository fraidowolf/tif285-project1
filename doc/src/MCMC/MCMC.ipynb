    "Note that this is more involved than traditional calculations in which we would use a single vector of parameters, e.g. denoted $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^*$, that we might have found by maximizing a likelihood (minimizing a chi-squared function). Instead, $\\langle f( \\boldsymbol{\\theta} ) \\rangle$ means that we do a multidimensional integral over the full range of possible $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ values, weighted by the probability density function, $p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} |D,I)$ that we have worked out.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The same sort of multidimensional integrals appear when we want to marginalize over a subset of parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_B$ to find a pdf for the rest, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_A$. E.g., when extracting the masses of binary black holes from gravitational-wave signals there are many (nuisance) parameters that characterize, e.g.,   background noise that should be integrated out.\n",

The straight and naive version of MC integration evaluates the integral by randomly distributing $n$ points in the multidimensional volume $V$ of possible parameter values $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$.

However, the result only gets better very slowly. Each additional decimal point accuracy costs you a factor of 100 in $n$.\n",

    "The key problem is that too much time is wasted in sampling regions where $p( \\boldsymbol{\\theta} |D,I )$ is very small. Consider the situation where the significant fraction for one parameter is $10^{-1}$. For a $m$-parameter problem the significant fraction of the volume is $10^{-m}$! This necessitates *importance sampling* which reweights the integrand to more appropriately distribute points (e.g. the [VEGAS algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VEGAS_algorithm)), but this is difficult to accomplish.\n",

    "The bottom line is that its not feasible to draw a series of independent random samples from $p ( \\boldsymbol{\\theta} | D,I )$ from large $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ dimensions.
